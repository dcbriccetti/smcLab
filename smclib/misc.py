	print("""The third possibility is rotating your head, i.e. rolling it from lying 
on your left shoulder to your right shoulder. 

There are others answers that might have been tempting, e.g. moving your nose forward or backward,
moving your head left to right (also known in dance as a "head slide"), or even standing up or sitting down,
which technically moves your head up and down. These three degrees of freedom are not orientation, but rather
position. That is, they say where you head is, and not how it is oriented.

Thus there are a total of six degrees of freedom for your head, three related to
orientation, and three related to position.
